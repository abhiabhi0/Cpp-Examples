// The += operator is being overloaded for the Account class in lines 8 to 10. Now, we can add and assign a double to an Account object without any problems. However, this will not support Account += Account, where both operands are of the Account type.

// For this purpose, we declare a friend function in line 13 to support the additional assignment between two Account objects. The friend function can access the private member, balance. Hence, we can perform a.balance + b.balance. The function has been implemented in lines 21 to 24.

// The << output operator has also been overloaded in a friend function on lines 26 to 29. Now, std::cout << acc; will print the balance of the acc object.

// From lines 39 to 43, we can see examples of the additional assignment working between the Account and double types.

// One thing to note is that the explicit operator call works when the argument is a double, as seen in line 45.

// However, the call would not work for the Account argument in line 46. This is because the class doesnâ€™t support the conversion from Account to double.
