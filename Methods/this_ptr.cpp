// The this pointer is being used in the copy operation on lines 8, 10, and 15.

// To check whether the assignee and assigned are the same object, we can use this. In such a case, we can simply return the dereferenced value of the this reference to our object.

// The class contains two attributes, a and b.

// In the newA() method, there is a variable named a. We can differentiate between the variable and the attribute by using this to access the attribute, as done on line 21.

// Since there isnâ€™t a b variable in the method, this->b and b mean the same thing (line 24). This is because every member already has an implicit this pointer.
